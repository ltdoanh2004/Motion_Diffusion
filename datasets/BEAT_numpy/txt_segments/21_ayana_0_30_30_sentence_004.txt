watching a flower wilts away to a brown husk is actually more depressing and will make you remove the flower the second it starts turning brown that isn't to say i don't like flowers i like them i just don't like things that are a waste to buy if i had to pick a flower that i liked i would pick a rose because roses are multi-layered they have beauty with the petals and pain with its thorns
