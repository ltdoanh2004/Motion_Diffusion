i want to mention that my school was over two miles long i spent the whole day wandering around the buildings including the ones i knew i'd be spending a lot of time in it was quite an adventure i learned about the club's i could join and extracurricular activities that i could be a part of this allowed me to be pretty knowledgeable about the things i could do on campus some of my roommates were foreign exchange students that i met later in my university life so i was able to show them around easily
