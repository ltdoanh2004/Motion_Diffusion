happened the angriest i've been was when one of the school bullies decided to pick on me i was upset at him and i decided i was going to fight him but since i didn't have friends with me his friends pretty much beat me up and ran over my hands with their bags and strangled me it wasn't a fun time that was the last schoolyard scrap i was ever in because it didn't solve anything the bullet was still a mean person and harassed many people in cool the funniest thing about this was that later in life the bullies brother started an anti-bullying program i hope his brother decided to go through it he was so mean and also extremely hurtful to people from other cultures i never wish to see that man again
