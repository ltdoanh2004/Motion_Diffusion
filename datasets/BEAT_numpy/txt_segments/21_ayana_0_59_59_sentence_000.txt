my favorite sport is running because it's very easy and free sport that everyone can try i started it about five months ago i tried to keep as healthy as possible and as i mentioned before it's also a very cheap and easy sport and all we need is a pair of running shoes and a bottle of water i made some new friends while running in the park they're quite nice and friendly people sometimes do you encourage each other to keep on and don't give up every i rides after i feel my body is great and after a few months of running i can run for longer hours without feeling tired i'm pretty happy about this free sport and i highly recommend it to everyone who wants to be
