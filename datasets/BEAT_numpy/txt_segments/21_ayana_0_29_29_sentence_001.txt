the last time i bought flowers was from my significant others birthday it was last month i think it's important to give flowers at the important events as it signifies life and prosperity i think if i didn't get flowers for her i would probably make her upset but i really do think that flowers liven up the room that they are in and it's nice for the while they are blooming
