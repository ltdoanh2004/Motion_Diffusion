i look down on people who cry in public a lot when someone gets a bad grade on a test and starts to sob it pisses me off it seems very manipulative because it's almost pressuring the people around you to comfort you when nothing bad had actually happened to me it's the same as when someone says i'm so ugly dumb blah blah blah and then waits for people around them to go know you're the smartest is coolest person i've ever met it's like they're turning people around them into their safety blanket
