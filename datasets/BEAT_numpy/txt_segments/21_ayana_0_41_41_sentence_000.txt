i would much rather to take a very long vacation rather than multiple short ones as when you're on a long vacation you can enjoy everything you can stop and smell the roses as they say when i was in vietnam i met a man who was a professional chef he told me that he worked only about six months of the year the rest of the time he spends in third world countries and uses his large salary to survive cheaply in those countries if i could afford like half the year i live a fun exciting life in a very cheap country i would be happy to work every single day for six months if i knew that all that hard work would pay off
