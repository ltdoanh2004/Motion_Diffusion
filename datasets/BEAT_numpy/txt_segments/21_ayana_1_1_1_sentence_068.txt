there's so much stuff there you can just let go and pick whatever you like and you can just order it and they'll deliver it right to your door so that's that's pretty good and i benefits of a machine made furniture and possibly they last a little bit longer to depending on the material that's used to make them and the axure errs because you know you have some very good furniture companies i don't know any names but the manufacturer once they do good work that's also like a benefit for a machine made thing versus a handmade thing and you can count on their reputation because you know other people who have gotten from them before and would have recommended that their furniture is good or bad or whatever you have reviews you can look at to kind of it i mean you know how good this product is and i think that's been 10 minutes
