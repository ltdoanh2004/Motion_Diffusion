in my spare time i really like to watch movies i think over the past few years because of the situation that has caused us to stay home for a while i've tried my hardest to avoid crowds and other people one of the best things you can do and kind of think about how things used to be before we had this kind of this change is watch movies i love a good film that makes you think about it after the movie is over if i could i wish i could make a movie
