the best time of the year for me is when i get to volunteer at the buddhist temple it includes leading the way for serving as guy as a guide for people who come to the buddhist temple last week i also went to the buddhist temple and was assigned the job of standing in front of the elevators to be a guy when people pass by i would greet them with a smile and bow
