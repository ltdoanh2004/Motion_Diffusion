recently and i don't musician named britney spears was just released from her father's power over her money as a musician so sometimes that goes beyond childhood into adulthood but i think it's better to take a little bit from both to allow children to know that they can spend money but at the same time have to understand that you can't just buy everything that you want if you don't let children use the money that they've earned they might become upset and asked why did i learn earn the money anyway if you allow them to purchase things that they find important to them they will be happy
