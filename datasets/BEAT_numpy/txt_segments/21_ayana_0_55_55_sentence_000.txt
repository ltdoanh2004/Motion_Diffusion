well it's a really difficult question in my opinion making more money doesn't always mean you'll be happier at work if the job i choose has an okay salary and at the same time if i can get personal satisfaction that would be great however if it has a very lowest salary i believe it would be very hard for anyone but i might choose to work a second job to support my job that can get personal satisfaction because i don't want to give it a job that can get started each
