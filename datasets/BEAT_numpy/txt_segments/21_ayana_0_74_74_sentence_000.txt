i think the thing that makes me angry is when someone is repeatedly late and always not on time being repeatedly late is a sign of disrespect it's easy to make people feel angry and i think most people understand that being late is a sign of not respecting another person's time it's okay to get angry at people who are always late and sometimes i know that i can't change other people's behavior but what i can change is how i react to it sometimes you need to a decision discussion with people say if you're always going to be late i don't want to make plans with you anymore this sets a clear boundary and states that you need to be treated fairly a good friend will understand and try to change a selfish friend will agree and still be late anyway however a codependent friend will attack you with unreasonable demands
