my favorite sports actually is swimming and i must say i love this sport very much but living in a city you think it would be easy to continue to practice this sport however i find it quite hard as you have to time out when you want to go to a busy pool i hate being surrounded by people and thinking about all the chemicals in the water at the pool makes me miss living in a warm tropical climates where i could go swim among almost every day of the year without the exception of two or three months as it's a little too cold
