there's a movie called time crimes that i would highly recommend it's a film from spain but if you're afraid to watch a movie that's in a completely different language you're in luck as they barely talk in this movie i apologize because i'm about to spoil this movie and half of the enjoyment is about learning what is happening while the film is going on
