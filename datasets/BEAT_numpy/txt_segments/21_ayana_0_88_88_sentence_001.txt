also i look down on people when they constantly blame others for the bad things happening to them but don't bother to think of solutions i have a friend who keeps complaining about how he owes 700 to his phone provider 1500 dollars in credit card debt etc etc but all he does is spend his money on cigarettes liquor sir and other drugs i suggest paying everything off little by little and putting some money aside to build a savings but he ignores it and the dead just keeps piling up
