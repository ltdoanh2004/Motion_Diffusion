i remember in 2015 i was in a rut i was working a dead-end job and unsure of what to do next i found myself as a crossroads i wasn't sure what the right answer was then i saw an opportunity to move to japan on a whim i decided to apply i never thought i would get a call back i forgot about it three months later i was sitting on my couch still trying to figure out what i should do in the future my phone rang and a person on the other end wanted to talk to me about heading to japan i couldn't believe that i was actually getting this chance i decided to continue further and within three months i was living a new life in japan i never thought i'd live outside of the usa but by myself but i made my goal a reality and i'm now living a life that i'm happy to be living doing jobs i'm happy and excited to do
