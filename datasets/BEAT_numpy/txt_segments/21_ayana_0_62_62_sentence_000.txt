so traveling during covid has been a nightmare i had to return to america for a family medical emergency and it was so hectic to get the pci checks within 72 hours and try to find the cheapest one in order to enter and exit the different countries this is an extra expense that should be provided by the airlines as it would help protect the crew regardless in america it's like the pandemic isn't even a thing most people are wearing masks mostly under their nose once you leave the airport you are free to basically do whatever you like coming back to japan is almost like being in a kafka story you have to go to multiple places waiting certain areas in those places then go to a hotel for six days at least you are a fan for six full days i just pretended it was part of the vacation but i wish it was easier but i'm happy we were all healthy and safe but it is amazing to see the differences in how different countries deal with the current set of events in the world
